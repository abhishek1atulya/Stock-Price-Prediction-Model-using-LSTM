# Stock-Price-Prediction-Model-using-LSTM

This repository contains a stock price prediction model implemented using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture with the Keras library. The model utilizes historical stock price data to predict future prices.

## Overview

The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time-series prediction tasks due to its ability to retain long-term dependencies in data sequences. In this project, we leverage the power of LSTM to predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you will need:

- Python (version 3.10 or above)
- Pandas library
- NumPy library
- Matplotlib library
- tensorflow library

You can install the required dependencies via pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib tensorflow
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/abhishek1atulya/stock-price-prediction.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```
cd stock-price-prediction
```

3. **Run the code:**

Execute the main script to train the LSTM model and make predictions:

```
just download and execute the code
```

4. **Input Data:**

Make sure you have a CSV file containing historical stock price data. The file should have at least two columns: `Date` and `Price`.

5. **Adjust Parameters:**

Feel free to adjust hyperparameters and model architecture in the `main.py` file according to your requirements and preferences.
